    "# Text Generation using Bidirectional LSTM and Doc2Vec models 2/3\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have reached directly this page, I suggest to start reading the first part of this article. It describes how to create a RNN model to generate a text, word after word.\n",
    "\n",
    "I finished the first part of the article explaining I will try to improve the generation of sentences, by detecting patterns in the sequences of sentences, not only in the sequences of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "It could be an improvement, because doing that, the context of a paragraph (is it a description of a countryside? a dialog between characters? which people are involved? what are the previous actions? etc.) could emerge and can be used to select wisely the next sentence of the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process will be similar to the previous one, however, I will have to vectorize all sentences in the text, and try to find patterns in sequences of these vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do that, we will use **Doc2Vec**.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Doc2Vec\n",
    "Doc2Vec is able to vectorize a paragraph of text. If you do not know it, I suggest to have a look on the gensim web site, that describes how its work and what you’re allowed to do with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a short, we will transform each sentences of our text in a vector of a specific space. The great thing of the approach is we will be able to compare them ; by example, to retrieve the most similar sentence of a given one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last but not least, the dimension of the vectors will be the same, whatever is the number of words in their linked sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is exactly what we are looking for: I will be able to train a new LSTM, trying to catch pattern from sequences of vectors of the same dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "``I have to be honest: I am not sure we can perform such task with enough accuracy, but let’s have some tests. It is an experiment, at worst, it will be a good exercice.``\n",
    "\n",
    "So, once all sentences will be converted to vectors, we will try to **train a new bidirectional LSTM**. It purpose will be to predict the best vector, next to a sequence of vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then how will we generate text ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pretty easy: thanks to our previous LSTM model, we will generate sentences as candidates to be the next phrase. We will infer their vectors using the **trained doc2Vec model**, then pick the closest one to the prediction of our new LSTM model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Create the Doc2Vec Model\n",
    "The first task is to create our **doc2vec model**, dedicated to our text and embedded sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Doc2Vec** assumes its input to be a list a words, with a label, per sentence:\n",
    "\n",
    "``Example: ['tobus', 'ouvre', 'la', 'porte', '.'] LABEL1``\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have to extract from the text each sentences and splits their words.\n",
    "\n",
    "by convention, I assume a sentence ends with “.”,”?”,”!”,”:” or “…”. The script reads each text, and create a new sentence each time it reaches on of these characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we load the Doc2Vec library, we load our data and set some parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "- all texts are stored in the **data_dir** directory,\n",
    "- the **file_list** list contains the names of all text files in the **data_dir** directory,\n",
    "- the **save_dir** will be used to save models.\n"
